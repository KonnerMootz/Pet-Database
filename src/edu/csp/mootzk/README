Pet Database Assignment

Issues experienced during development:

* Scanner skipping user input
    * Cause: nextLine was taking user's "enter" key as the entry
    * Resolution: Catch the empty line with another nextLine call.

* Handling errors when different type of data is entered
    * Cause: User enters letter instead of number, etc
    * Resolution: Try Catch blocks with exception handling

* How to re-populate ArrayList from txt file
    * Cause: Needed way to get up to date info from text file
    * Resolution: Create File Management class > readDatabaseFile method which returns txt file data as ArrayList

* How to separate string, only getting name and age (and providing error when more or less than that is entered)
    * Cause: Allowing incorrect user entry
    * Resolution: regex pattern matching for specific values

* Program not accepting done command when case incorrect
    * User types done is case that isn't specified
    * Set user input as lower case and compare that to string: "done"

* Program not using correct .group() for pattern matching
    * Cause: .group() seems to start at one and not zero
    * Resolution: Update group numbering to one and three
    * Ex: String name = matchPetInfo.group(1); String petAge = matchPetInfo.group(3);

* Error message stating you need to pass objects of similar type
    * Cause: Was trying to pass String ArrayList
    * Resolution: Change ArrayList type to Pet Object

* Program accepting Pet ID one higher than available
    * Cause: Using ArrayList .size() will be one higher than requested since ArrayList is index zero
    * Resolution: Subtract one from size when comparing.  Ex:  if (petID > pets.size() - 1)

* Program not returning pets that match first couple of letters
    * Ex: Searching for "dog" does not return "doggy"
    * Cause: Was using .equals() comparison
    * Resolution: Use .contains() instead
